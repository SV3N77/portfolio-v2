In this project I used react-query and its ability\nto query cache so that if the same query is searched then it doesn't need to fetch another time. I also implemented infinite scroll with both react-query\nand NextJS getStaticProps so that if you scroll down to the bottom it will load more results.\n\nThe AnimeDB was an amazing project which further enhanced my web development knowledge and was enjoyable to create. I am most proud of this project\nas it shows the accumalation of my knowledge in web development.\n",
