AnimeDB was one my recent project, I worked upon, using my experience from my previous projects and learning to use a public API.
Utilising the public Kistu.io API, this project displays the various details of anime and manga.

### Features

- Search for anime titles
- Shows most trending anime
- Click into anime to show more details
- Shows related franchises of anime/manga
- Shows all characters in anime/manga

AnimeDB was an amazing project to do as this project allowed me to learn to use a public API. In this project I used react-query and its ability
to query cache so that if the same query is searched then it doesn't need to fetch another time. I also implemented infinite scroll with both react-query
and NextJS getStaticProps so that if you scroll down to the bottom it will load more results.

The AnimeDB was an amazing project which further enhanced my web development knowledge and was enjoyable to create. I am most proud of this project
as it shows the accumalation of my knowledge in web development.
