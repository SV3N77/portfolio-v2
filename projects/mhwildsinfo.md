One of my most recent projects, I worked upon, using my experience from my previous projects and learning to use a public API. This
project is a website that displays information about Monster Hunter Wilds. It is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more.

### Features

- Shows infomation about weapons and armors in the game.
- Shows all of the items and consumables in the game.
- Shows all of the monsters in the game.
- Shows all of the decorations in the game.

This project was a great learning experience for me as I learned to use a public API. I also learned how to use the Shadcn UI library
which is a great library for creating websites. I also learned how to use the TailwindCSS library which is a great library for styling websites.
